# ShellCheck Configuration for A.R.C. Framework
# Documentation: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Directive

# Default shell dialect
shell=bash

# Enable additional optional checks
enable=require-variable-braces
enable=quote-safe-variables

# Disabled checks with justification
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
# Rationale: Sometimes intentional word splitting is desired for arrays
# We manually verify these cases - use # shellcheck disable=SC2086 inline
# disable=SC2086

# SC1091: Not following sourced files
# Rationale: ShellCheck can't always find sourced files in CI
disable=SC1091

# External sources - directories to search for sourced files
source-path=scripts/
source-path=scripts/setup/
source-path=scripts/validate/
source-path=.github/scripts/ci/

# Severity level (error, warning, info, style)
# Set to 'warning' to fail on warnings in CI
severity=warning
