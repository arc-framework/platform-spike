  # Exporter 1: Send logs to Loki via OTLP
  # The 'loki' exporter is no longer in the default contrib image.
  # We use the standard otlphttp exporter, as Loki supports OTLP natively.
  otlphttp/loki:
    endpoint: "http://loki:3100/otlp/v1/logs"
    # OTLP uses HTTP headers for auth, not a specific config block.
    # Headers can be set here if needed, e.g., for multi-tenancy.

    #   "X-Scope-OrgID": "my-tenant"

  # The 'logging' exporter is deprecated and has been replaced by 'debug'.

    verbosity: detailed # Use 'detailed' for the most verbose output, similar to 'loglevel: debug'

  # Exporter 3: Send traces to Jaeger via OTLP
  # The dedicated 'jaeger' exporter is deprecated. Jaeger natively supports OTLP.
