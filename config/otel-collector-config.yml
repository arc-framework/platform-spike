receivers:
  otlp: # Receives data on ports 4317 (gRPC) and 4318 (HTTP)
    protocols:
      grpc: # Explicitly set the endpoint to listen on all network interfaces.
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http: # Do the same for the HTTP receiver for consistency.
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  batch: # Batches data for efficiency
  # This processor is crucial for linking logs with traces. It uses OTTL
  # to copy the trace_id and span_id from the log's context into its attributes.
  transform:
    log_statements:
      - context: log
        statements:
          - set(attributes["trace_id"], trace_id)
          - set(attributes["span_id"], span_id)

exporters:
  # Exporter 1: Send logs to Loki via OTLP
  # The 'loki' exporter is no longer in the default contrib image.
  # We use the standard otlphttp exporter, as Loki supports OTLP natively.
  otlphttp/loki:
    endpoint: "http://loki:3100/otlp/v1/logs"
    # OTLP uses HTTP headers for auth, not a specific config block.
    # Headers can be set here if needed, e.g., for multi-tenancy.
    # headers:
    #   "X-Scope-OrgID": "my-tenant"

  # Exporter 2: (For debugging) Spit everything to the console
  # The 'logging' exporter is deprecated and has been replaced by 'debug'.
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed # Use 'detailed' for the most verbose output, similar to 'loglevel: debug'

  # Exporter 3: Send traces to Jaeger via OTLP
  # The dedicated 'jaeger' exporter is deprecated. Jaeger natively supports OTLP.
  otlp/jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:4317 # Jaeger's OTLP gRPC endpoint
    tls:
      insecure: true

  # Exporter 4: Make metrics available for Prometheus to scrape
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8889" # An internal port for Prometheus to scrape

extensions:
  health_check:
    # The health check extension is available on all interfaces by default.
