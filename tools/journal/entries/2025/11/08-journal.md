## 👥 For Non-Technical Stakeholders

### What This Means in Plain English

**Problem We Solved:**
We continued building and improving the A.R.C. platform infrastructure, which provides the foundation for running AI agents reliably.

**What We Built:**
Today's work focused on steady progress across the platform components.

**Why It Matters:**
Each improvement makes the system more reliable, easier to maintain, and better prepared for production use.

**Real-World Analogy:**
This is like building a house - we're ensuring the foundation is solid, the utilities work properly, and everything is documented so others can maintain it.

### User Impact

- **Who benefits:** Development team and future platform users
- **How they benefit:** More reliable infrastructure, better observability, cleaner code organization
- **When available:** Continuous improvements being deployed

### Business Value

- **Efficiency gains:** Better organized code reduces maintenance time
